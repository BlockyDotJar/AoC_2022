# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 Solutions in Java

### What the fuq is this?

This repository contains solutions to [Eric Wastls](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) Advent of Code 2022. 
<br>**Thank you, Eric!**

While the code aims to be as fast as possible (the goal is to complete all puzzles of 2022 in under one second), 
I often lack the time and/or knowledge to optimize it properly.

**Note:** This code isn't a masterpiece and i am not a Java Pro, so don't expect that this is the best Java code, 
you have ever seen and there probably won't be all 25 day solutions.

Like i said, this is not the *best* or maybe not even a *good* solution.
